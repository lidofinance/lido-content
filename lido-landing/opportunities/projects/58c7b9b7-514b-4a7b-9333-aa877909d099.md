  The Talent Acquisition workstream supports entities contributing to the Lido
  protocol by helping them identify and secure exceptional talent in highly
  competitive, global markets. We work closely with contributors on critical
  search mandates, combining deep market research with thoughtful, high-signal
  candidate engagement.\

  We’re looking for a self-directed recruiting researcher with a strong curiosity for talent markets and executive search. You’ll be responsible for talent mapping, market intelligence, and supporting complex searches across crypto, engineering, and institutional-grade roles.\

  This role suits someone who wants real exposure to high-impact search work, is comfortable operating with autonomy, and takes pride in doing rigorous, insight-driven work.


  ### Key Scope


  * Conduct deep, proactive talent research across priority markets, building and maintaining high-quality candidate pipelines for active and future search mandates.

  * Identify, map, and track talent ecosystems across crypto, engineering, and institutional finance, moving from raw research to actionable shortlists and outreach strategies.

  * Support end-to-end search execution, from initial market intelligence through candidate engagement and progression.

  * Operate independently across multiple searches, coordinating directly with contributors as needed.

  * Produce clear, structured research outputs (market maps, role briefs, compensation insights) to inform hiring decisions and search strategy.

  * Stay close to ongoing developments across crypto, and adjacent talent markets, continuously feeding insights back into active searches.


  ### Qualifications


  * 1-4 years of experience in recruiting, executive search, or in-house talent roles, with meaningful exposure to research-heavy or hard-to-fill searches.

  * Demonstrated strength in talent research, market mapping, and sourcing, beyond transactional candidate delivery.

  * Comfortable operating with high autonomy: able to manage multiple searches or research streams and follow work through end-to-end.

  * Strong written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to synthesize market and candidate insights clearly.

  * High work ethic and ownership mindset; thrives in a fast-moving, remote, contributor-led environment.

  * Experience recruiting for crypto-native teams.


  ### Key Factors


  * Contribute from anywhere in the world

  * Competitive compensation level

  * Flexible schedule

  * Equipment & co-working reimbursement program


  This is not a high-volume recruiting role; we value depth, judgment, and precision over activity.
