  We are looking for a hands-on Quantitative Analyst to help the Lido Ecosystem
  Foundation and the Lido DAO Treasury make sharper, data-driven treasury,
  liquidity, and risk decisions across on-chain and off-chain venues. You’ll
  blend markets knowledge with rigorous modeling to improve asset allocation,
  design smarter liquidity mechanisms, and support day-to-day liquidity
  operations across EVM ecosystems.


  ### Key Scope


  * **Asset allocation & treasury research:** Contribute to quantitative frameworks and dashboards that improve asset allocation for the Foundations and to support DAO proposals (and their operationalization) regarding Lido DAO Treasury asset diversification.

  * **Vault research & advisory:** Provide research and advisory support to curators of [Lido-affiliated vaults]({{ethereum_stake_url}}/earn), including drafting analytical notes, risk/return modeling, and monitoring of current vault allocations.

  * **Treasury management**: Support the development of an asset allocation model for the Lido DAO Treasury and support treasury management efforts of the Lido Labs and Lido Ecosystem Foundations.

  * **Liquidity modeling:** Model stETH liquidity across on-chain AMMs, RFQ/MM venues, and centralized exchanges; quantify slippage, depth, and execution quality; stress test scenarios.

  * **Market structure & LP management:** Support negotiation of centralized-exchange liquidity provision agreements; monitor and report KPIs.

  * **On-chain liquidity operations:** Implement/support liquidity management across L2s/L1 and other EVM chains (bridging, rebalancing, routing).

  * **Mechanism & tooling design:** Prototype and evaluate improved mechanisms for liquidity provision (e.g., a liquidity buffer for the Lido Core protocol with dynamic fee structure) and collaborate with engineering to ship production-grade tools.

  * **Risk, monitoring & reporting:** Build automated risk metrics, alerting, and weekly/monthly reports for stakeholders; communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.


  ### Qualifications


  * Master’s degree in Quantitative Economics/Finance, Statistics, Data Science, Computer Science, or a closely related field.

  * 0-4 years of full-time professional experience, with some experience in financial services (e.g., buyside, sellside, risk management, market making, treasury, fintech, or crypto).

  * Proficiency in Python, SQL, version control (git) and statistical modelling; ability to write clean, production-ready analyses.

  * Strong understanding of (crypto) market microstructure and portfolio/risk concepts.

  * Genuine interest in crypto/digital assets and on-chain market structure.

  * Comfort collaborating with both technical and non-technical internal (engineering, business development, finance) as well as a variety of external stakeholders.


  ### Nice to have


  * Experience with the general DeFi landscape, DeFi/AMM models, on-chain analytics.

  * Experience writing queries for and building dashboards for onchain analytics on the Dune Analytics platform.

  * Familiarity with EVM concepts, onchain data, bridging/L2 ecosystems, and basic solidity literacy (reading contracts, event decoding).

  * Practical experience with dashboarding (preferably Python-based frameworks) and data engineering basics; some experience with basic CI/CD workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions).


  ### Key Factors


  * **Organization:** Lido Ecosystem Foundation (working closely with Lido Labs Foundation and contributing to the Lido DAO)

  * **Compensation:** USD $120,000-$140,000 base (12-month contract) + performance-based component

  * **Experience:** 0-4 years full-time professional experience

  * **Location:** Globally remote (option for hybrid work in Zug / CH)
