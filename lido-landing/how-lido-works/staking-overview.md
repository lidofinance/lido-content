  Lido is the name of a family of open-source peer-to-system software tools
  deployed and functioning on Ethereum, focused on facilitating the security of
  the network with liquid staking. Liquid staking connects individuals and
  institutions looking to stake their ETH (provide security to the Ethereum
  network and earn staking rewards) with Node Operators running the
  infrastructure required for staking. Lido further enables users to mint
  transferable liquid staking tokens that receive rewards linked to staking,
  unlocking other activities including DeFi.
