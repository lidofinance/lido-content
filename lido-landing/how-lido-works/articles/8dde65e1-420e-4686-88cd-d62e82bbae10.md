  The Lido Staking Protocol ("Lido") is staking middleware that lets you participate in decentralized Ethereum staking without locking up your tokens. By staking through Lido, you receive a liquid token called stETH, which represents your staked ETH and reflects earned rewards (or accrued penalties), all while remaining usable within DeFi and the broader ecosystem. Lido operates via a set of smart contracts on Ethereum that manage deposits, reward distributions, and withdrawals in a non-custodial manner. Additionally, off-chain services tightly integrate with the protocol to support proper operations for deposits, withdrawals, and accounting flows.


  The Lido Protocol involves three major actors and their interactions:


  #### Staking Users


  Individuals or entities who wish to stake their ETH and receive stETH through the Lido protocol.

  #### Node Operators


  Individuals or entities that run validators using ETH provided by staking users in a non-custodial manner. *Learn more.* [will lead to [Lido Node Operator Set Overview](https://www.notion.so/HLW-new-structure-202bf633d0c98056a6ddf8e3b682e23d?pvs=21)]

  #### Lido DAO


  A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that oversees the protocol's long-term development and maintenance. It is governed by LDO (Lido governance token) holders approving upgrades, deciding on key parameters and setting fees, facilitating node-operator participation and managing oracle operator sets, and empowering committees to handle defined operational tasks.
