title: Lido Node Operators Set Overview

    [picture]
    

    **Node Operators (NOs)** run the validator infrastructure securing Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network. They provide computational resources for block validation and attestation while operating in a non-custodial model, ensuring users retain control of their staked ETH.
    

    NOs are selected and overseen by the Lido DAO, and evaluated on reliability, performance, and adherence to policies on MEV extraction and validator exits. Lido’s validator set prioritizes decentralization and high performance, balancing security with a diverse range of operators to enhance network resilience.
    
    #### Staking Router and Staking Modules
    
    Lido's Staking Router is a flexible framework that routes ETH deposits to different staking modules, each hosting validator cohorts operating under distinct principles.
    

    The Staking Router allocates ETH to these modules based on a "bottom-up" approach. Modules have stake shares which are essentially ceilings on the maximum amount of stake that can be allocated to a module. Stake is allocated to the module with the least amount of active stake, provided the module has capacity (i.e. depositable validators) and is below its maximum stake share. At the same time, exits are prioritized for operators and modules that have the highest amount of stake. This means that organically, the protocol prioritizes exits from larger operators, and prioritizes allocation to smaller operators (within the defined limits), optimizing decentralization of stake over time.

    
    This system enhances the protocol’s resilience and decentralization.
    
    #### The main modules include:

      title: "Curated Module"
      image: "![](img/withdrawals_1.png)"
      description: "The default, battle-tested module. It distributes deposits among professional NOs curated by the Lido DAO based on strict reliability and performance criteria. The curated operators registry  is  reviewed and adjusted via DAO governance to maintain high standards and adapt to network needs. With no share limits, the module can absorb any amount of stake, and serves as the fallback module when other, smaller, modules are either at full capacity or do not have depositable validators. Node Operators in the Curated Module run validators as they see fit, including using DVT, with guidance from DAO contributors with regards to optimizing the decentralization of the protocol along the axes of geographic, jurisdictional, infrastructural, and software decentralization."

      title: "Simple DVT Module"
      image: "![](img/withdrawals_1.png)"
      description: " The Simple DVT Module allows Node Operators of all types and sizes -- from home stakers to professionals -- to work in concert in so-called Operator Clusters to run validators together using  Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). DVT improves fault tolerance by distributing a validator’s duties across multiple NOs. This approach reduces slashing risks and enhances security. Simple DVT houses clusters using both Obol and SSV DVT technologies."

      title: "Community Staking Module (CSM)"
      image: "![](img/withdrawals_1.png)"
      description: "The CSM is the permissionless module of the Lido Core. Although any NO type can use the module, one of the core aims of CSM is to empower community stakers (individuals running validators in a non-professional capacity), thereby increasing the number of NOs using Lido to run validators and increasing the decentralization of the underlying validator set.  As the module is permissionless, instead of reputation, CSM requires a stETH bond from operators. It employs automated performance monitoring and advanced mechanisms for validator withdrawal and slashing proofs, enhancing transparency and decentralization."

      title: "Deposit flow: Show your keys first"
      image: "![](img/withdrawals_1.png)"
      description: "To be eligible for  ETH deposits, Node Operators ****must register valid validator public keys with the protocol. These keys are verified for uniqueness, correct signatures, and compatibility with consensus specifications. Some staking modules employ optimistic vetting, where keys are considered valid unless flagged by the Deposit Security Module (DSM) guardians."

    > ##### Deposit Security Module
  
    >
  
    > The Deposit Security Module (DSM) is a critical safeguard in Lido’s architecture, designed to protect user deposits from malicious behavior by Node Operators. It prevents exploits such as injecting unauthorized withdrawal credentials or reusing validator keys. The DSM uses a committee of six guardians, requiring a quorum of four to sign deposit transaction data. In case of suspicious activity, the module can halt deposits to ensure safety. Transparency is maintained as all deposit data is published to the publicly observable DataBus contract, ensuring that any party can execute deposits without gating or permissions.
