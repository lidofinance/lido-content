  Staking on Ethereum involves locking 32+ ether (ETH) to secure the blockchain by running a network validator. Validators propose and validate blocks, earning rewards for performing their duties timely and correctly, or facing penalties for downtime or rule violations.


  Staking can be approached in three main ways:


  #### Solo Staking


  The original, most decentralized method requires you to run your own validator node. It demands 32 ETH+ per validator, technical expertise, and ongoing maintenance. Solo stakers have full control over funds and keys and bear all operational responsibilities and risks.

  #### Delegated Staking


  Delegated staking involves delegating your ETH to a third-party  service provider, which is often a single Node Operator, but may be a custodial service which sub-contracts to Node Operators. This approach lowers technical barriers and reduces the minimum ETH requirement to stake. Depending on the setup, delegated staking can be custodial or non-custodial, meaning you may retain full control over your funds or entrust them to the service provider. It also relies on the provider's integrity and security practices.

  #### Liquid Staking


  Staking through a liquid staking protocol like Lido is the easiest way to stake. ETH deposits  receive a token representing staked ETH. Liquid staking tokens accrue rewards (and potential penalties) and can be freely transferred, used in DeFi, or redeemed for ETH, combining staking rewards with liquidity.
