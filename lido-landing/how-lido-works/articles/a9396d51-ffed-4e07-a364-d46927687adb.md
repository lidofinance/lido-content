  Lido offers two tokenized forms of the same staked ETH: stETH and wstETH. Both tokens represent your staked ETH and allow you to participate in the Ethereum ecosystem while earning staking rewards, but they behave differently and are suitable for different use cases.


  ### **stETH**


  The default token you receive when staking with Lido. Your stETH balance updates daily to reflect earned rewards, so your holdings potentially grow automatically over time. You can use stETH within various applications, and its balance adjusts without any manual action on your part. Because stETH grows in quantity, it’s useful in applications that support rebasing tokens,  where the balance can change automatically. However, some DeFi protocols don’t support this type of token behavior.

  ### **wstETH**


  Wrapped stETH (wstETH) is a non-rebasing version of stETH. Unlike stETH, the balance of wstETH remains fixed; instead, the value per unit increases to reflect earned rewards. This wrapping process effectively locks the staking growth into the token’s price rather than its quantity, making wstETH ideal for protocols or scenarios where a constant token balance is required. wstETH is better suited for DeFi protocols that require fixed-balance tokens, for example, lending platforms, vaults, or smart contracts that don’t handle rebasing.

  ### **Converting between stETH and wstETH, and the key difference:**


  **Key difference**: The main distinction between stETH and wstETH lies in how they handle rewards:


  - **stETH**: Your balance increases as rewards accrue.

  - **wstETH**: The token's value per unit increases while your balance stays the same.


  You can convert freely between stETH and wstETH using Lido UI or supported DeFi apps. Both tokens represent the same staking position, but they differ in how that position is tracked over time (balance vs. value).

  One of the core benefits of liquid staking is the ability to use your staked tokens while still earning staking rewards. Both **stETH** and **wstETH** are integrated into a wide range of DeFi protocols across Ethereum and supported chains.


  ### **Possible DeFi use-cases:**


  - **Lending and borrowing**: One of the most common DeFi integrations for Lido tokens is lending and borrowing on platforms like Aave. In this use case, users can deposit their stETH or wstETH as collateral to borrow other assets such as stablecoins or ETH. Alternatively, users can lend their tokens to earn third-party rewards on top of the staking rewards already accruing from Lido.

  - **Leveraged staking:** In leveraged staking, stETH is used as collateral to borrow ETH, which is then staked again, creating a loop that amplifies staking growth. While leveraged staking can enhance rewards, it also introduces increased liquidation risk due to price volatility or shifts in protocol parameters.


  ---


  - **Diversified rewards:** Lido tokens can also be used in structured DeFi products designed to optimize or diversify staking yield. These products may include auto-compounding vaults, fixed yield, or variable yield instruments. These mechanisms are ideal for users seeking more control over the way their rewards are generated or distributed.

  - **Restaking:** Through restaking protocols users can commit their stETH/wstETH as collateral and receive LRTs (liquid restaking tokens) with third-party rewards, which may include protocol points, tokens, or additional rewards.

  ### **Using stETH and wstETH in DeFi**


  When interacting with DeFi platforms, it’s important to understand the difference between stETH and wstETH. **stETH** is a rebasing token—its balance increases daily to reflect staking rewards. However, not all DeFi protocols can support rebasing behavior. In such cases, **wstETH** is used instead. It wraps stETH into a non-rebasing format, keeping the token balance constant while the value increases over time.


  Many platforms support wstETH as the preferred format for integrations. Users can freely convert between the two formats using the Lido UI or directly through supported DeFi apps. Before using any specific DeFi product, it’s recommended to verify which token format is supported. For an up-to-date overview of supported integrations, token formats, and network availability, refer to the DeFi app itself or to the [Lido Ecosystem page.](https://lido.fi/lido-ecosystem)
