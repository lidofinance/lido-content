  As part of its ongoing commitment to security and community collaboration, the Lido DAO has established [a bug bounty program](https://lido.fi/bug-bounty) as a standing invitation for the wider security community to help keep the protocol safe. The program is hosted on the [Immunefi platform](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/lido/information/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), one of the most trusted and established hubs for DeFi security-research initiatives.


  Through this initiative, independent researchers are encouraged to identify and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities in Lido’s smart contracts and applications. Verified discoveries can earn rewards, with higher payouts reserved for issues of greater severity. The program’s scope covers a range of potential threats, including direct loss of user funds, denial-of-service risks, governance manipulation, and data exposure. To ensure ethical participation, all submissions must include a clear proof of concept, and testing must never disrupt production systems or fall outside the defined boundaries of responsible disclosure.


  Through this open invitation to white-hat researchers worldwide, Lido DAO embraces a proactive model: rather than waiting for threats to emerge, Lido DAO asks the community to help discover and fix them. The result is a broader network of oversight, stronger safeguards, and a more resilient protocol overall.
