title: Known risks
content: >



  Below are some of the most notable risks associated with the usage of the Lido Protocol. Most of these risks are systematically addressed through the most effective mitigation strategy — decentralization. Lido contributors actively track decentralization metrics via the [Decentralization Scorecard](https://lido.fi/scorecard) to provide transparency and highlight areas for improvement.


  #### Slashing Risks


  Validators can potentially face staking penalties. In very extreme cases of slashing (i.e. validator behavior seen as malicious by the rest of the network), up to 100% of staked funds could be at risk, but such scenarios would necessitate severe client software bugs, malicious takeover, or the compromise of multiple large node operators, leading to correlated slashing penalties. To minimize this risk, the Lido Protocol maintains a diverse validator set, with hundreds of participating node operators. The protocol's protections include:


  - **Decentralization**: Each unique entity controls less than 1% of the Ethereum network's validators.

  - **Diversified  Node Operators and setups**: Hundreds of independent operators spread across the world employ heterogeneous client and infrastructure setups to reduce systemic risks.

  - **Ad hoc slashing fund**: An ad hoc fund set aside by Lido DAO provides an additional safety net against severe slashing events. This fund, operated  via a transparent [vault contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8B3f33234ABD88493c0Cd28De33D583B70beDe35), holds around 6,600 stETH for potential coverage of severe losses. The use of the fund is subject to governance, requiring DAO discussions and approval before execution. If activated, the stETH in the fund would be burned, positively adjusting the share rate for stETH holders.

  #### Oracle Data Manipulation Risks


  The Lido Protocol relies on an [Oracle Committee](https://research.lido.fi/t/expansion-of-lidos-ethereum-oracle-set/2836?ref=blog.lido.fi) to report external data, including validator states and balances on the Consensus Layer. This data can affect  the internal protocol rate of stETH to ETH through [rebasing](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/lido?ref=blog.lido.fi#rebase). In a worst-case scenario, a compromise of the majority of the Oracle Committee (i.e. five or more of the 9 members)  could report incorrect balances, which could lead to triggering of significant negative rebases. Users should bear in mind risks related to stETH rebasing when entering into complex DeFi positions, such as leveraged staking or borrowing uncorrelated assets (such as stables) against stETH positions. 


  **Mitigation Measures**:


  - The oracle software is open-sourced and all material changes are audited by professional third-party security auditors before being used on Ethereum mainnet.

  - The Oracle Committee is made up of nine independent oracle operators.

  - **OracleReportSanityChecker**: An in-protocol safety net that verifies incoming reports against abnormal changes, requiring governance intervention if anomalies are detected.

  - **Trustless data availability**: Ongoing efforts to make Oracle-provided data verifiable on-chain using technologies like zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs).

  #### Governance Misalignment


  A principal-agent problem exists between **LDO** holders and **stETH** holders, posing a risk that governance power could be misused to substantively alter the protocol and drastically increase protocol fees, or extract ETH from stakers toward malicious actors. This risk becomes slightly more  substantial with the advent of  **EIP-7002**, which enables the DAO to use the Lido withdrawal credentials contract to trigger validator exits regardless of Node Operator control, although mass exit of validators would take a very long time (weeks to months), giving the DAO time to respond via further governance action.


  **Mitigation Measures**:


  - **Two-phase voting:** On-chain voting has a special period called the ‘objection phase’, which concludes every voting period. This phase allows LDO holders to object to unexpected last-minute decisions, effectively creating a ‘better timelock’ protection lasting 24 hours at the moment of writing.

  - **DualGovernance system**: Under implementation and scheduled for Mainnet release in Q1 2025, this system introduces a "foot voting" mechanism for stETH holders. It allows them to:
      - **Exit Window**: Exit the protocol before governance changes take effect.
      - **Cancel unwanted changes**: Overturn governance-induced changes by achieving a large quorum of stETH holders (over 10% of Total Value Locked).

  #### Implementation Risks: Bugs, misconfigurations, and hidden vulnerabilities


  As with any software system, the protocol may be subject to hidden bugs, misconfigurations, and undiscovered vulnerabilities.


  **Mitigation Measures**:


  - **Rigorous development processes**: Adhering to strict development protocols for both on-chain and off-chain components.

  - **Design principles**: Emphasizing robust architecture and focusing on edge cases, and having emergency and failure modes covered at the spec level.

  - **Specification drafting**: Creating detailed documentation before implementation.

  - **Comprehensive testing**: Including unit tests, integration tests, and testing in diverse environments.

  - **External audits**: Engaging third-party security experts to review code.

  - **Fuzzing and formal verification**: Using advanced techniques to uncover vulnerabilities.

  - **Pre-deployment and acceptance testing**: Ensuring all contracts and off-chain software are initialized, function, and safeguarded as intended before going live.

  - **Bug Bounty Program:** Engaging experts to identify and report vulnerabilities through rewards. [Learn more.](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/lido/)

  #### Ethereum PoS Economy Risks


  The Lido Protocol relies on the design and economic principles of Ethereum's Consensus Layer. While the protocol continually adapts to changes from network upgrades and hard forks, there is a tail risk that fundamental changes to the Consensus Layer's economic principles — or even network deprecation — could impact Lido.


  **Mitigation Measures**:


  - **Active participation**: Engaging in Ethereum network roadmap discussions.

  - **Community involvement**: Inviting the broader community to discuss potential impacts.

  - **Liquid staking advocacy**: Raising concerns and questions that may affect liquid staking protocols, leveraging Lido's position as a significant actor within the Ethereum ecosystem.

  #### Token Price and Liquidity Risks


  Users face the risk that the  price of stTokens (like stETH) on secondary markets (e.g. DEXs and CEXs) may be lower than their inherent value in ETH due to supply and demand market dynamics. Although the in-protocol withdrawal mechanism usually means that secondary market exchange rates converge towards the in-protocol ETH:stETH rate over time, since withdrawals are not instant (owing to the validator exit and withdrawal mechanisms of Ethereum's PoS implementation), arbitrage of disparity between primary market and secondary market rates happens over time.


  **Mitigation Measures**:


  - **Transparency**: The Lido DAO is committed to communicating these risks openly.

  - **Risk management**: Ongoing efforts to minimize these risks through protocol improvements and community engagement.
