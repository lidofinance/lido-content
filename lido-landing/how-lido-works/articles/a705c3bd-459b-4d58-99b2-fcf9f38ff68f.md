  Protocol APR means Annual Percentage Rate (APR)  â€” the overall Consensus Layer (CL) and Execution Layer (EL) rewards received by Lido validators to total pooled ETH, estimated as a moving average of the last 7 days.


  > ##### APR Calculation

  >

  > To estimate the protocol's APR over a historical period and calculate rewards for a specific account, you can track the change in the `totalPooledEther / totalShares` value over time, known as **the share rate**. This value defines how much ETH corresponds to the underlying minted stETH token shares and changes only during the stETH token rebase event (accessible programmatically in the Lido contract as `TokenRebased`).
