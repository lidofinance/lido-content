  Protocol APR means Annual Percentage Rate (APR)  â€” the overall Consensus Layer (CL) and Execution Layer (EL) rewards received by Lido validators relative to total ETH in the protocol. APR may be calculated over a variety of time ranges. The APR displayed on Lido UI is calculated as a rolling moving average over the last 7 days. The detailed info could be found [here.](https://docs.lido.fi/#protocol-apr)

  > ##### APR Calculation
  To estimate the protocol's APR over a historical period and calculate rewards for a specific account, you can track the change in the `totalPooledEther / totalShares` value over time, known as the share rate. This value defines how much ETH corresponds to the underlying minted stETH token shares and changes only during the stETH token rebase event (accessible programmatically in the Lido contract as `TokenRebased`).
