    Withdrawal times depend on queue size, buffer availability, and validator exit dynamics. High demand may increase wait times, with secondary markets providing an alternative for quick liquidity

  #### unstETH

  **unstETH** is a non-fungible token (NFT) that represents withdrawal requests you've placed in the protocol. When you initiate a withdrawal, unstETH is minted to represent your position in the withdrawal queue. This token is transferable and can potentially be integrated into DeFi applications.

  Each unstETH token includes:

  - A unique incremental ID representing your position within the withdrawal queue.
  - The amount of stETH you've requested to withdraw.
  - Once finalized and not yet claimed, the amount of ETH to be transferred to you.

  When you claim your ETH, the unstETH token is burned, completing the withdrawal process.
