  The Lido Protocol, from the very beginning, is built on trust in code, and that trust comes from careful and continuous verification. Every component of the Lido Protocol has gone through multiple layers of independent review by leading blockchain security firms. Over the years, experts from  Certora, MixBytes, Statemind, Ackee, OpenZeppelin Consensys Diligence, ChainSecurity, Oxorio, Hexens, and SigmaPrime have examined Lido’s smart contracts, looking for ways to make them safer and more reliable. The results of these reviews are full audit reports and code-verification summaries, which are publicly available for anyone to explore [here](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits#lido-protocol-audits).


  To make the audit process more structured and consistent, the [Lido DAO formed the Audits Committee](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-on-ethereum-form-audits-committee/3481) to coordinate all security reviews across the protocol, ensuring that every major code change receives proper review before deployment. The committee manages the schedule of audits, works with trusted security partners, and keeps a transparent record of all completed work. Its goal is not just to react to potential issues but to maintain a continuous cycle of prevention, verification, and improvement.


  Through this combination of external expertise and internal oversight, Lido DAO aims to uphold a high standard of security and transparency. The auditing process isn’t just a checkbox, but rather an ongoing practice that helps keep the protocol resilient, trustworthy, and open for public review.
