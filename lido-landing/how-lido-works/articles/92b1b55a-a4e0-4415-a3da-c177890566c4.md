  As the scope of the protocol expands and the number of partnerships, network integrations, and application launches grows, the Lido DAO recognised the need for an additional layer of oversight, but not to replace audits, rather to make the review process more responsive, scalable, and transparent. To meet that need, [the Audits Committee proposed the creation of The Guild for Review and Assessment of Protocols and Applications: GRAPPA](https://research.lido.fi/t/establishment-of-the-guild-for-review-and-assessment-of-protocols-and-applications-grappa/8997), a dedicated security workgroup tasked with reviewing protocol changes and verifying multi-chain deployments.


  GRAPPA is designed to function as a guiding workgroup (not a formal governance committee), accountable to the Audits Committee. The role of GRAPPA includes manual security reviews of protocol-level changes, verification of deployments referred to as Lido Multichain, consultations on emerging features, and the publication of summary review reports for the community. In doing so, Lido DAO seeks to maintain high standards of security and deployment quality across its growing universe of activities, making it easier to scale confidently, launch faster, and keep the community informed.
