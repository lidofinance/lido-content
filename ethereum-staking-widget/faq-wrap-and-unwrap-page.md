  - question: What is wstETH?
    questionId: What_Is_wstETH
    answer: wstETH (wrapped stETH) is a non-rebasing version of stETH, wstETH's
      price denominated in stETH changes instead. The wstETH balance can only be
      changed upon transfers, minting, and burning. At any given time, anyone
      holding wstETH can convert any amount of it to stETH at a fixed rate, and
      vice versa. Normally, the rate gets updated once a day, when stETH
      undergoes a rebase.
  - question: How can I get wstETH?
    questionId: How_Can_I_Get_wstETH
    answer: You can wrap your stETH or ETH tokens using [Wrap & Unwrap staking
      widget](https://stake.lido.fi/wrap/) or [DEX Lido
      integrations](https://lido.fi/lido-ecosystem?tokens=wstETH&categories=Get)
  - question: How can I use wstETH?
    questionId: How_Can_I_Use_wstETH
    answer: wstETH is useful
      across [L2](https://lido.fi/lido-ecosystem?networks=arbitrum%2Coptimism) and
      other [DeFi protocols](https://lido.fi/lido-ecosystem?tokens=wstETH),
      which are based on constant balance tokens.
  - question: Do I get my staking rewards if I wrap stETH to wstETH?
    questionId: Do_I_Get_My_Staking_Rewards_If_I_Wrap_stETH_To_wstETH
    answer: Yes, wrapped stETH gets staking rewards at the same rate as regular
      stETH. When you keep your stETH in a wrapper you cannot see your daily
      staking rewards. However, when you unwrap your wstETH your new stETH
      balance will have increased relative to pre-wrapped amount to reflect your
      received rewards.
  - question: Do I need to claim my staking rewards if I wrap stETH to wstETH?
    questionId: Do_I_Need_To_Claim_My_Staking_Rewards_If_I_Wrap_stETH_To_wstETH
    answer: No, staking rewards accrue to wstETH automatically.
  - question: How could I unwrap wstETH back to stETH?
    questionId: How_Could_I_Unwrap_wstETH_Back_To_stETH
    answer: You can unwrap your wstETH tokens using [Wrap & Unwrap staking
      widget](https://stake.lido.fi/wrap/unwrap/).
  - question: Do I need to unwrap my wstETH before requesting withdrawals?
    questionId: Do_I_Need_To_Unwrap_My_wstETH_Before_Requesting_Withdrawals
    answer: >-
      \

      No, you can transform your wstETH to ETH using the [Withdrawals Request and Claim tabs](https://stake.lido.fi/withdrawals/request/). Note that, under the hood, wstETH will unwrap to stETH first, so your request will be denominated in stETH.
