      - question: What is Lido?
        questionId: whatIsLido
        answer: Lido is the name of a family of open-source peer-to-system software
          tools deployed and functioning on the Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon
          blockchain networks. The software enables users to mint transferable
          utility tokens, which receive rewards linked to the related validation
          activities of writing data to the blockchain, while the tokens can be
          used in other on-chain activities.
      - question: How does Lido work?
        questionId: howDoesLidoWork
        answer: While each network works differently, generally, the Lido protocols
          batch user tokens to stake with validators and route the staking
          packages to network staking contracts. Users mint amounts of stTokens
          which correspond to the amount of tokens sent as stake and they
          receive staking rewards. When they unstake, they burn the stToken to
          initiate the network-specific withdrawal process to withdraw the
          balance of stake and rewards.
      - question: Is it safe to work with Lido?
        questionId: isItSafeToWorkWithLido
        answer: >-
          In order to work safe, Lido fits the next points:


          * Open-sourcing & continuous review of all code.

          * Committee of elected, best-in-class validators to minimise staking risk.

          * Use of non-custodial staking service to eliminate counterparty risk.

          * Use of DAO for governance decisions & to manage risk factors.

          * Lido has been audited by Certora, StateMind, Hexens, ChainSecurity, Oxorio, MixBytes, SigmaPrime, Quantstamp. Lido audits can be found in more detail [here](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits).


          Usually when staking ETH you choose only one validator. In the case of Lido you stake across many validators, minimising your staking risk.
      - question: What are the risks of staking with Lido?
        questionId: whatAreTheRisksOfStakingWithLido
        answer: >-
          There exist a number of potential risks when staking using liquid
          staking protocols.


          * Smart contract security

            There is an inherent risk that Lido could contain a smart contract vulnerability or bug. The Lido code is open-sourced, audited and covered by an extensive bug bounty program to minimise this risk. To mitigate smart contract risks, all of the core Lido contracts are audited. Audit reports can be found [here](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits#lido-protocol-audits). Besides, Lido is covered with a massive [Immunefi bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/lido/).
          * Slashing risk

            Validators risk staking penalties, with up to 100% of staked funds at risk if validators fail. To minimise this risk, Lido stakes across multiple professional and reputable node operators with heterogeneous setups, with additional mitigation in the form of self-coverage.
          * stToken price risk

            Users risk an exchange price of stTokens which is lower than inherent value due to withdrawal restrictions on Lido, making arbitrage and risk-free market-making impossible. The Lido DAO is driven to mitigate the above risks and eliminate them entirely to the extent possible. Despite this, they may still exist and, as such, it is our duty to communicate them.
