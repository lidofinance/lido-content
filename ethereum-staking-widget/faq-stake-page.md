  - question: What is Lido?
    questionId: What_Is_Lido
    answer: Lido is the name of a family of open-source peer-to-system software
      tools deployed and functioning on the Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon
      blockchain networks. The software enables users to mint transferable
      utility tokens, which receive rewards linked to the related validation
      activities of writing data to the blockchain, while the tokens can be used
      in other on-chain activities.
  - question: How does Lido work?
    questionId: How_Does_Lido_Work
    answer: While each network works differently, generally, the Lido protocols
      batch user tokens to stake with validators and route the staking packages
      to network staking contracts. Users mint amounts of stTokens which
      correspond to the amount of tokens sent as stake and they receive staking
      rewards. When they unstake, they burn the stToken to initiate the
      network-specific withdrawal process to withdraw the balance of stake and
      rewards.
